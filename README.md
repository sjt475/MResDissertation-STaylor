# MResDissertation-STaylor
The code used to analyse Sam Taylor's MRes Sustainable Futures Dissertation, including raw datasets and rmarkdown files used to generate the report.

The MResDissCompile.Rmd file combines all the files for each section of the dissertation after running both R files that perform the necessary analysis. It should also check that all necessary packages are installed for this to run, but if it does not, check the MRes-Dissertation-R-Analysis file and try manually installing the packages listed there.

The rcode folder contains the necessary files for replicating the main analysis.

The data folder contains the raw datasets and the table of stimuli. Additionally, a copy of the qualtrics questionnaire is available as a word document.

The writeup folder contains the individual files for each section of the dissertation. Some sections (e.g. results) tend to not run on their own unless the data has been loaded into r using the rcode folder, but will work when using the compile RMD file. The images subfolder contains the pre-rendered diagrammes used in the code.
