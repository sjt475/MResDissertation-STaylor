In this part of the study we examine how people make estimates of facts about British society. 
For the success of this study, it is very important that you read the instructions below carefully and follow them as much as you can. Thank you for your understanding!
You will make several estimates from 0 to 100, such as ""Out of every 100 people in the UK, how many use the internet daily?"". 
Some of the questions are very difficult, so don't be surprised if many estimates are difficult for you, this is completely normal. We politely ask you to not use a search engine for the purposes of this task: as researchers we are interested in the estimates you believe to be true about each fact.
Remember that the more accurate your estimates are, the higher the chance that you will win an Amazon voucher.
