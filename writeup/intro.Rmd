# Introduction {.unnumbered}

In order to tackle growing social challenges such as climate change, there is a need to reduce dogmatism, the tendency for individuals to think and act in accordance with strongly held beliefs without considering opposing evidence, and encourage people to become more open-minded about the assumptions behind their attitudes and different courses of action [@gifford2013]. For example, when considering climate change, attempts to improve sustainability through radical behaviour change have been hampered by polarisation in political attitudes and beliefs that any action is doomed to failure [@gifford2011]. Resultingly, there have been calls for psychological research on reducing dogmatism and encouraging more open-minded thinking to be "among psychology's most pressing priorities" [@lilienfeld2009]. One such reason is that people often base their environmental attitudes and motivations to enact pro-environmental behaviours on rigidly held but inaccurate assumptions [@holmgren2019], which can result in both inaction for individuals to engage directly in pro-environmental behaviours, and also in an absence of pro-environmental attitudes altogether [@gifford2011]. In order to try to increase more open-minded styles of thinking in regards to pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours, this paper aims to take a technique previously used to improve the accuracy of estimates in other domains such as the estimation of the dates of historical events [@herzog2009; @herzog2014] called *dialectical bootstrapping*, and develop it into a general social psychological tool to improve open-minded thinking and reduce dogmatism in the assumptions behind pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours.

## Dialectical Bootstrapping and Considering the Opposite {.unnumbered}

*Dialectical bootstrapping* [@herzog2009] is a technique that aims to improve the accuracy of estimation. Dialectical bootstrapping draws on the logic of its namesake, *Hegelian dialectics*, which relies on a process of an initial *thesis* being counter-acted by an *antithesis*, before reaching a more effective *synthesis* between the two [@maybee2020]. Similarly, dialectical bootstrapping takes an initial estimate of a parameter from an individual, then asks them to reconsider the assumptions behind their initial estimate and provide a *dialectical estimate*, which is combined (or "*bootstrapped*") with the initial estimate. In the vein of traditional Hegelian dialectics, this bootstrapping, or *synthesis*, should result in more accurate estimations than either a single estimate alone or the combination of an initial estimate with a second non-dialectical *repeated* estimate[^i1].

[^i1]: For the rest of this paper, *repeated estimate* refers specifically to a second estimate where individuals are asked to imagine they had not previously made an estimate and were doing so for the first time; *dialectical estimate* to a second estimate given with dialectical instructions asking individuals to rethink their prior assumptions; and *second estimate* refers more generally to a second repeated **or** dialectical estimate.

The theoretical origins of the dialectical bootstrapping literature lie in attempts to capture the *"wisdom of the crowds"* phenomenon [@surowiecki2005] within individuals. A growing body of research suggests that the average estimations of large groups (or *crowds*) of people are more accurate than those of individuals [@page2007]. This effect has been found in a diverse range of domains such as estimating the revenues of popular films to predicting election results and sporting fixture outcomes [see @wolfers2004 for a review]. The theoretical explanation for this phenomenon tends to rely on different individuals within a group having different sources of error from the truth, or *bias,* to their assumptions and estimations. Error within a judgement can be thought of both in terms of *random* error and *systematic* error. Although individuals may tend to draw on the same assumptions across multiple estimations of the same phenomena, all judgements contain a degree of *random* error that cause fluctuations in estimation; for example, how tired or angry an individual is when making an judgement [@vul2008]. However, some error also tends to be *systematic*; different individuals may be prone to consistently under- or over-estimating certain judgements. For example, if half of people tend to *underestimate* the carbon footprint of travelling by car, whilst the other half tend to *overestimate* it, then the average of their estimates will fall somewhat close to the truth; conversely, individuals are generally systematically biased in one direction or the other. As a result, the "wisdom of the crowds" phenomenon results in improved estimation of crowds when compared with individuals when the allocations of biases in opposite directions essentially cancel out. This effect can be utilised directly when making collective decisions; for example, through representative government or the use of referenda [@murr2011; @boon2012]. However, the effect is less useful when attempting to encourage greater thought in decision making at the *individual* level.

Attempts have been made using the *consider the opposite* technique [@lord] to produce a similar reduction of bias by increasing open-minded thinking in individual judgement and attitude formation. Studies investigating the consider the opposite effect generally ask individuals to rethink what a judgement, belief or attitude would be if their original assumptions were untrue. For example, participants asked to consider the opposite showed less attitude polarisation (the tendency to make current attitudes more extreme in the face of new evidence) in response to counter-attitudinal arguments [Study 1, @lord] and were less likely to engage in confirmation bias in a task where they were asked to judge the degree of extroversion in an interview candidate by asking fewer questions which were likely to confirm the initial impression given by the experimenter [Study 2, @lord]. Effects have also been found in other social psychological areas, such as reducing the biasing role of context in impression formation [@petty1984], and tend to be more effective than more cognitively demanding attempts at reducing bias such as asking individuals to think objectively [@lord]. More importantly, these positive effects of considering the opposite have been found to generalise outside of their initial domain. For example, @goclowska2013 asked participants to generate stereotypical or counter-stereotypical descriptions of individuals before getting them to engage in a divergent thinking task, which asks participants to list as many ideas as possible that come to mind as a measure of creativity. As well as being less prejudiced in their descriptions, participants asked to generate counter stereotypes showed greater creativity in the divergent thinking task. Thus, considering the opposite has been demonstrated to be an effective tool at improving open-minding thinking within individuals*;* however, it has generally been applied to more qualitative oriented tasks than to quantitative estimation.

Dialectical bootstrapping attempts to solve this problem by combining the wisdom of the crowds phenomenon [@surowiecki2005] with findings on the consider the opposite technique [@lord]. When asking participants to make a second estimate which considers different assumptions to the first, the direction of *systematic* error from the true value is likely to differ between initial estimates and the second dialectical estimate based on opposite assumptions. Therefore, averaging these two estimates is likely to reduce error compared to either of these individual estimates alone, as in the wisdom of the crowds effect [@surowiecki2005]. Notice that there is little reason to believe these second *dialectical estimates* should be more accurate than the first on their own; if an initial estimate is inaccurate by a certain degree of *under*-estimation, an estimate made using the opposite assumptions is likely to be inaccurate by a similar degree of *over*-estimation. However, averaging these two estimates should cause these two directionally opposing but magnitudinally similar sources of error to cancel each other out. Furthermore, averaging two estimates such as these should also succeed in cancelling out some of the directional *random* error [fluctuations between estimates due to extraneous factors that can influence decision making, such as alterations to mood; see @blanchette2010] participants tend to make between estimates [@vul2008], as this error should fluctuate randomly in terms of direction and magnitude. Notably, any kind of repeated estimation should help to reduce this kind of random error, but only dialectical bootstrapping should reduce systematic error.

Systematic error is reduced in this way by dialectically bootstrapping two estimates that *bracket* the truth (fall on either side of it). If a true value is 50%, and two estimates of 25% and 75% are combined, that combined estimate displays no error from the true value, despite the individual estimates both being off by 25%. However, if one were to combine an estimate of 75% with a slightly lower estimate of 65%, the error of the combined score would still be fairly large at 15%; the same as the average error of both individual estimates. A visual illustration of the principles behind bracketing is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pngbracket). The former type of estimation change is more likely to happen when individuals think dialectically for their second estimate [@herzog2009], as the estimations are based on opposite assumptions (much like the *consider the opposite* strategy used on less quantitative tasks). As such, the "bracketing rate" for initial and dialectical estimates is likely to be quite high. However, the latter situation is more likely to occur if individuals are merely asked to provide a second estimation similar to the first. These individuals are less likely to see similar benefits from averaging assumptions as those asked to provide a second *dialectical* estimate, as the assumptions behind these estimates are likely more similar, and as a result the systematic error within both estimations is likely to be in the same direction. Thus, by improving the bracketing rate of estimations, dialectical bootstrapping aims to capture the wisdom of the crowds within a single individual [@herzog2009] using a consider the opposite style technique.

```{r pngbracket, fig.cap="Visual illustration of the principles behind how bracketing estimates can reduce error.

Thus, error is not reduced by bootstrapping these estimates.", out.width="100%"}

```

Studies generally support this logic. The most common dependent variable used to assess the success of this strategy within studies is *accuracy gain*, which is the decrease in error (defined as the deviation of an estimate from a given "true value" for a stimulus) from averaging first and second estimates compared with using the first estimate alone; this is usually averaged across items into a single score. Thus, a positive accuracy gain score indicates that the average of both estimates was more accurate than a single estimate, whilst a negative accuracy gain score would indicate that averaging estimates was less accurate than one estimate alone (although this is unlikely given that averaging alone should reduce random error). Using this criterion, compared to single estimations from one person or averaging two non-dialectical estimates, dialectal bootstrapping has proven effective in improving estimations of the year in which significant historical events occurred [including in the original study by @herzog2009; Study 1, @keck2020]; in estimating the outcome of football games [Study 2, @keck2020]; and in estimating the weight of people in photographs [Study 3, @keck2020]. Naturalistic data from 1.2 million competitors in estimation competitions also supports the idea that averaging multiple estimates within individuals improves accuracy compared to taking a single estimate, particularly when there is a reasonable time difference between estimates [@vandolder2018]. Generally, the improvements in accuracy seen by dialectical bootstrapping are not of similar magnitude to those seen when taking advantage of the wisdom of the crowds by averaging estimates *between* individuals [@ariely2000; @herzog2009], but are still more accurate than single estimates or asking participants to choose the best of two estimates [@herzog2014; @litvinova2020]. There is thus a strong empirical basis behind dialectical bootstrapping as a method of encouraging individuals to rethink the assumptions behind their estimates and improve the accuracy of their judgements.

## A Social Psychological Tool? {.unnumbered}

If the initial work on the *consider the opposite* strategy was heavily embedded within social psychological domains such as making participants more open-minded about attitude change [@lord] and impression formation [@petty1984], the work on *dialectical bootstrapping* took a more cognitive decision-making approach. However, similarly to the spillover effects to other domains seen by consider the opposite strategies [e.g. @goclowska2013; @lord], dialectical bootstrapping may result in similar effects in social psychological domains such as reducing dogmatism. Despite this, most dialectical bootstrapping research tends to be focused on its usage as a method of *improving the accuracy* of estimations rather than open-mindedness itself [e.g. @herzog2009; @keck2020]. Whilst the greater accuracy in averaged estimates seen by participants given dialectical instructions suggests that these participants are more willing to consider assumptions counter to their own, this direct link between the process of thinking dialectically and social cognitive processes such as open-mindedness has not been explicitly examined. However, given the increases in accuracy observed by the empirical studies [e.g. @herzog2009] and the theoretical basis behind dialectical bootstrapping and considering the opposite as a means of encouraging people to change their assumptions, there is an empirical basis to more explicitly investigate whether dialectical bootstrapping causes individuals to continue to think in a more open-minded way generally after completing the task.

In order to use dialectical bootstrapping to better investigate these types of research questions, there is a need to adapt the task to use stimuli more typical of social psychological studies. Social cognition is primarily interested in phenomenon such as attitudes and stereotypes [@hunt2012], and when compared to the types of stimuli typically used in dialectical bootstrapping, such as date estimation [@herzog2009], these issues are much more affected by social cognitive processes such as stereotyping, schematic thinking and prior beliefs<!--# ref? -->. As such, a version of the dialectical bootstrapping paradigm using social phenomena as stimuli would be more appropriate to investigate research questions such as whether dialectical bootstrapping impacts dogmatism in pro-environmental attitudes. One source of such stimuli is Ipsos MORI's *Perils in Perception* programme of research [@ipsosmori2016; @ipsosmori2017; @ipsosmori2018; @ipsosmori2020; @ipsosmori2021]. This is a collection of data-sets that aims to highlight some of the biases and errors people generally make in estimating aspects of social phenomena, including topics such as the frequency of different causes of death [-@ipsosmori2016], prevalence of attitudes towards sexual morality [-@ipsosmori2018] and the impact of different behaviours on the climate [-@ipsosmori2021].

The imperative to adapt dialectical bootstrapping to social issues is thus twofold. Firstly, it may prove beneficial in making people more accurate in their estimations of social phenomena. This is of interest itself; for example, if environmentally conscious individuals become more accurate in estimating the carbon footprint of different choices for common behaviours such as mode of travel, they may better improve their daily behaviours to reduce their impact on the climate [@gifford2011; @gifford2013]. Secondly, outside of improving the accuracy of judgements, there may be spillover effects that foster open-minded thinking more generally. If participants who have been encouraged to engage in this style of dialectical thinking are more likely to change the assumptions behind their estimates *within* the study, they may be encouraged to alter the *assumptions* behind their judgements and beliefs more generally, becoming less dogmatic and more willing to consider changes to other beliefs such as their environmental attitudes. Furthermore, if the dialectical bootstrapping process depends on changes to open-mindedness, relationships should be observed between measures of open-mindedness and changes between first and second estimates and accuracy gain.

The open-mindedness spillover effect that is the focus of this study is pro-environmental attitude change. As the dialectical instructions target changes in *assumptions* behind beliefs and judgements [@herzog2009; @herzog2014], dialectical bootstrapping could have positive benefits to attitudes about the environment in two ways. Firstly, it may directly affect the assumptions behind attitudes themselves. For example, if an individual does not believe (and thus *assumes*) that human activity is responsible for climate change, they may have less positive attitudes towards measures to mitigate it such as household recycling; if humans are not causing climate change, there is little reason to do anything to mitigate it. An individual who has engaged in dialectical thinking in a dialectical bootstrapping task may be encouraged to challenge the assumptions behind the judgements that led to the formation and maintenance of these attitudes. Through changing this assumption, dialectical bootstrapping could result in attitude change towards a more pro-environmental attitude. Secondly, dialectical bootstrapping may help to close the well documented *attitude-behaviour* gap within individuals who have pro-environmental attitudes, but less sustainable behaviours [e.g. @kollmuss2002, @juvan2014, @yamoah2019]. Under a framework such as the Theory of Planned Behaviour [@ajzen1991], behaviour is influenced by factors other than attitudes such as social norms and the difficulty we envisage in successfully carrying out that behaviour (e.g. perceived behavioural control). An individual may very well have a positive attitude towards reducing car use in order to reduce carbon emissions, but if they believe that the impact their own individual usage is negligible, they may decide this behaviour change is not worth the effort. Dialectical bootstrapping could thus help to close this attitude-behaviour gap by causing individuals to rethink the assumptions behind influences on their behaviour other than attitudes, such as rethinking the direct impact on carbon emissions of their own behaviours: an aspect where individuals tend to have inaccurate assumptions [@holmgren2019].

Additionally, when considering whether dialectical bootstrapping can reduce dogmatism and increase open-minded thinking, it is worth considering that there may be individual difference boundary conditions that influence *who* sees benefits in accuracy gain of estimations and increases in open-mindedness from dialectical bootstrapping. For example, *Need for Cognitive Closure* [@webster1994], measured by the *Need for Closure Scale,* ( *NFCS*) captures individual differences in the tendency to prefer rigid and ordered thought process, discomfort in ambiguity and close-mindedness. Individuals high in NFCS generally show less creativity [@ortega-martín2021], higher levels of dogmatism and intolerance of ambiguity [@leone1999] and faster, more hasty decisions [@evans2017]. As a result, participants high in NFCS may be less likely engage in the necessary cognitive processes required to change the assumptions behind their beliefs; this in turn may result in a lower likelihood of seeing strong accuracy gains or spillover effects from dialectical bootstrapping. Conversely, *Open-Minded Cognition* [*OMC;* @price2015], is a cognitive style characterised by consideration of several intellectual perspectives in terms of values, beliefs and opinions. On the other hand, those low in OMC engage in *close-minded cognition* based on a more rigid set of value and belief perspectives*.* As such, individuals low in OMC may struggle to break this pattern of thinking when engaging with the dialectical instructions and show reduced effects of dialectical bootstrapping. These two distinct but similar measures of individual differences in rigid thought structures (NFCS) and open-minded thought patterns (OMC) respectively may thus help to discover some of the boundary conditions around dialectical bootstrapping effects.

## Pilot Study {.unnumbered}

The design of the present study was informed by an initial pilot study [@taylor2021] run using a convenience sample (*N*=111) that aimed to provide an initial replication of the dialectical bootstrapping effects seen by @herzog2014 and others with stimuli related to social phenomena as a "proof of concept" for further developing the dialectical bootstrapping paradigm as a tool for social psychological research. Participants were presented with stimuli from the *Perils in Perception* data-sets [@ipsosmori2016; @ipsosmori2017; @ipsosmori2018; @ipsosmori2020] and asked to estimate the frequency of these phenomena; for example, "out of every 100 people, how many do you think are obese?". Participants were either asked to make a second dialectical estimate (given the same instructions to imagine that the assumptions behind their initial estimates were wrong as those given in @herzog2009; *dialectical bootstrapping* condition) or a second *repeated* estimate ("imagine that you had just started the study and were making these estimates for the first time"; *repeated estimates* condition). These estimates were compared with true values taken from Ipsos MORI's data-sets. This pilot study failed to find a positive accuracy gain effect in either condition, with no significant benefit to dialectically bootstrapping compared to either a single estimate or combining repeated estimates without dialectical instructions. Exploratory posthoc analyses investigating the degree to which participants changed their second estimate compared to the first, which could be viewed as a proxy-measure of open-mindedness within the task, found that participants in the *dialectical bootstrapping* condition made much greater changes to their second estimates compared to their first estimates than participants in the control (repeated estimates) condition.

## Present Study {.unnumbered}

As such, this study aimed to build on the pilot study by using a more carefully selected set of stimuli based on the *Perils in Perception* data-sets [@ipsosmori2016; @ipsosmori2017; @ipsosmori2018; @ipsosmori2020], recruiting a larger random sample to achieve greater statistical power and generalisability, as well as expanding measures of open-minded thinking to sustainability related attitude objects and examine boundary conditions in terms of individual differences. For the estimation task, the version used in the present study was similar to that used in the pilot study, with the exception that stimuli were selected based on their statistical properties (including degree of over- and under-estimation and skewness) as well as for diversity in topics, and these stimuli were displayed one at a time in a random order.

To see whether the impacts of dialectical bootstrapping on open-mindedness extend beyond the task and impact beliefs about topics related to sustainability, we included two attitude objects related to sustainability and climate change, which were measured both before and after the main estimation task to track changes. Household recycling was chosen as the first attitude object, as it is an easily relatable everyday sustainable concern. As a result, there is scope for participants to have strongly formed attitudes towards it, and there is the possibility for ambivalence in that whilst recycling is often seen as a public good, it is also sometimes seen as an inconvenience [e.g. @ojala2008]. There is impetus to examine attitude ambivalence towards recycling as having an ambivalent attitude towards recycling can be a barrier to action even in those with positive attitudes towards recycling [@castro2009]. Secondly, the activist movement Extinction Rebellion [-@extinctionrebellion2021; -@extinctionrebellion2019] were chosen due to being a more abstract, politically controversial attitude object. Whilst many sympethise with their aims of mitigating climate change, their actions have sometimes alienated those who share their goals [@bell2021]; as a result, attitudes tend to be mixed in terms of their overall valence and ambivalence, with supporters often having strong positive attitudes and vice-versa for detractors [@bevan2020]. The differences between these two attitude objects reflect the diversity of the stimuli used in this study, which range from questions about more mundane everyday phenomenon (e.g. owning a smartphone) to more abstract social judgements (e.g. whether sex before marriage is morally acceptable; full list of stimuli is reported later in the Methods section), and allow investigation of whether the dialectical bootstrapping paradigm has differential effects on these two types of attitude. Later studies using the could aim to further investigate whether dialectical bootstrapping helps to reduce attitude-behaviour gaps.

Finally, we included measures of both *Open-Minded Cognition* [*OMC;* @price2015] and the *Need for Closure Scale* [*NFCS;* @webster1994] as measures of open-minded thinking to explore the boundary conditions of dialectical bootstrapping. These two measures are generally only weakly related [correlation of *r*=-.18 in the original study by @price2015], suggesting that they measure related but distinct aspects of open-mindedness that may be related to dialectical bootstrapping. NFCS is more concerned with the way thoughts and beliefs are formed and structured; items such as "I do not usually consult many different opinions before forming my own view" directly allude to the theoretical basis of the "wisdom of the crowds" effect. Conversely, OMC measures a more general thinking style that incorporates multiple perspectives (e.g. "I am open to considering other viewpoints"). As there are theoretical reasons (as discussed earlier) for why each of these concepts may relate to the dialectical bootstrapping process, there is impetus to test whether each of these individual difference measures are related to differences in accuracy gain and estimate change in the dialectical bootstrapping paradigm.

There were thus four main research questions this study aimed to address, summarised below.

### 1. Developing Dialectical Bootstrapping as a Social Psychological Tool {.unnumbered}

The first aim of this study was to begin developing a dialectical bootstrapping paradigm that can be more easily applied to reducing dogmatism; additionally, a secondary goal is to develop the paradigm to explore other related social psychological research questions, including increasing creativity or attitude change. As such, we need to see whether the dialectical instructions work with a set of stimuli based on *social phenomenon* rather than facts and examine whether the positive effects of dialectical bootstrapping replicate with them:

#### Hypothesis 1. {.unnumbered}

If the dialectical bootstrapping effects [e.g. @herzog2009; @herzog2014; @litvinova2020] replicate with frequency of social phenomena as stimuli, there will be positive *accuracy gain* in the *dialectical bootstrapping* condition that will be greater than that in the *repeated estimates* (control) condition. As the effect has been replicated with dates in a few studies [e.g. @herzog2014; @herzog2009], no condition using dates was included to reduce the required number of participants necessary for our desired levels of statistical power; any comparison will be made to the original results reported in these studies.

### 2. Examining Open-mindedness in the Estimation Task {.unnumbered}

Secondly, as we are interested in changes in open-mindedness more broadly rather than strictly its effect on increased accuracy as in prior dialectical bootstrapping studies [e.g. @herzog2014; @herzog2009; @litvinova2020], we are interested in whether participants in the dialectical bootstrapping condition change their second estimate compared to their first estimate more than participants asked to make repeated estimates. This implies that participants in the dialectical bootstrapping condition have become more open-minded to changing the assumptions behind their estimations when making their second estimates:

#### Hypothesis 2. {.unnumbered}

If the dialectical bootstrapping instructions encourage participants to be more open-minded *within* the task, participants in the *dialectical bootstrapping* condition should show larger changes between their first and second estimations than participants in the *repeated estimates* condition.

### 3. Exploring Spillover Effects on Open-mindedness {.unnumbered}

Although changes within the task are themselves of interest in considering potential applications of dialectical bootstrapping to *estimations*, if the process causes participants to become more open-minded *generally*, we should observe spillover effects of increased open-mindedness in other domains. These findings should increase our knowledge of dialectical bootstrapping as a more general tool for increasing open-mindedness within the domain of sustainability.

#### Hypothesis 3. {.unnumbered}

If greater changes in open-mindedness in the *dialectical bootstrapping* condition within the task have spillover effects *outside* of the task, participants should report attitudes becoming more ambivalent and less strong upon second measurement after the estimation task than participants in the *repeated estimates* condition. There may also be greater changes in attitude content, although the lack of persuasive information presented makes this unlikely [@rydell2006].

### 4. Associating Dialectical Bootstrapping with Individual Differences in Open-Mindedness {.unnumbered}

Finally, if the process of dialectical bootstrapping is related to open-mindedness, it is likely that any changes in open-mindedness (as measured by bigger estimate and attitude changes) will be moderated by related individual difference measures in open-mindedness.

#### Hypothesis 4. {.unnumbered}

If the dialectical bootstrapping process is uniquely predicted by individual differences in open-minded cognition and rigid structured forms of thinking, changes in *accuracy gain* and *estimate change* should be weaker in those *low* in OMC and *high* in NFCS. As these variables may directly influence the act of thinking dialectically, it is likely that this relationship will be stronger or even exist only in the *dialectical bootstrapping* condition.
