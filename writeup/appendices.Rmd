## Study Information {.unnumbered .unlisted}

### Hypotheses {.unnumbered .unlisted}

We expect that the dialectical bootstrapping procedure should improve judgment accuracy (small to medium effect size). The accuracy gain for a participant is defined, following @herzog2009, as the mean decrease in error of the average of the two estimates relative to the first estimate, across items.

The second aim of the study is to maximize the effectiveness of the dialectical bootstrapping procedure. To this goal, we will conduct an item-based analysis for accuracy gain and determine how much the accuracy gain varies across items (item difficulty) and between participants on each item (heterogeneity). Further, we will analyze inter-item correlations for accuracy gain to determine if dialectical bootstrapping consistently improves performance.

## Design Plan {.unnumbered .unlisted}

### Study type {.unnumbered .unlisted}

Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials.

### Blinding {.unnumbered .unlisted}

Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects (either human or non-human subjects) will not be aware of the assigned treatments (commonly known as "double blind"). 

### Study design {.unnumbered .unlisted}

On each trial of the dialectical bootstrapping paradigm participants make 2 estimates of a testable fact (e.g., How many people in the UK are obese or overweight?). The researchers manipulate instructions regarding the second estimate (between subject manipulation). For instance, some participants may only be asked to produce a "second estimate" while others may be asked to produce a "dialectical estimate" -- an estimate that draws on opposite assumptions to the ones that guided the first estimate.

### Randomization {.unnumbered .unlisted}

Between-subject randomisation: Participants will be randomly assigned to the dialectical or second estimate condition.

Item randomisation: Order of items within the first and second estimation block will be randomised.

## Sampling Plan {.unnumbered .unlisted}

### Existing Data {.unnumbered .unlisted}

Registration prior to creation of data.

### Explanation of existing data {.unnumbered .unlisted}

No data is yet available for this first preregistered study at the point of registration.

### Data collection procedures {.unnumbered .unlisted}

We will exclude responses from participants (1) younger than 18, (2) non-UK residents, (3) those who do not consent to the use of their data as well as (4) those who fail an attention test or (5) take an extremely long or short time to complete the study. (6) We will also not analyse data from partial respondents as quitting the browser was specified, for research participants, as a way of withdrawing from the study.

Data will be collected via the (1) Department of Psychology Research Pool (2) Social media and the internet (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Reddit etc.). Participants from the Psychology Research Pool will be rewarded with course credit. Furthermore all participants will have the chance to win an Amazon voucher. If we are unsuccessful in collecting sufficient number of responses using the above methods we will consider collecting data via (3) Prolific Academic and paying research participants for the completion of the study.

We aim to collect 200 valid responses from participants. This means that we will monitor the exclusion criteria and will stop the data collection only after 200 of the collected responses qualify as suitable for inclusion.

We aim for the study to last, on average, no longer than 30 minutes.

### Sample size {.unnumbered .unlisted}

We aim to collect 200 valid participant responses. This should allow us to achieve Power = .80 assuming a 2-tailed test, p \<.05 and a medium effect size.

### Sample size rationale {.unnumbered .unlisted}

Previous studies on dialectical bootstrapping found an accuracy gain difference between the second estimates and the dialectical condition of d = .24 - .66 @herzog2014. A conservative assessment of a medium effect size d = .40 would thus require us to collect valid 100 responses per condition in a two-tailed test (Power = .80, p \< .05).

### Stopping rule {.unnumbered .unlisted}

N/A.

## Variables {.unnumbered .unlisted}

### Manipulated variables {.unnumbered .unlisted}

We will use similar wording to that by Herzog and colleagues (2014). In the repeated estimate condition participants will be asked to produce a repeated estimate, as if they were making the estimation for one more time. In the dialectical estimate condition participants will be asked to make a second estimate using assumptions that are opposite to what they have thought of initially.

### Measured variables {.unnumbered .unlisted}

The key outcome measures are participants' responses to estimation tasks
in T1 and T2. The questions will be the same in both testing times and a
full list of those questions, together with the correct answers, can be
found below.

Estimation items used ("Out of 100 people in the UK."...):

1. how many do you think do not affiliate themselves with any religion?
(actual:45)

2. how many do you think are immigrants to this country (i.e. not born in
this country?) (actual:13)

17. about how many working age people do you think are unemployed and
looking for work? (actual:4)

18. how many do you think have a Facebook account (who are old enough to
have one, i.e. 13 and over)? (actual:76)

19. how many do you think have access to the internet at home either
through a computer or mobile device?(actual:96)

UK) and is used by the research team (but not shown to participants).

### Indices {.unnumbered .unlisted}

The accuracy gain for a participant is defined, following Herzog et al.,
(2009), as the mean decrease in error of the average of the two
estimates relative to the first estimate, across items. We will compute
this in the following steps (formatted for SPSS, but may be calculated using R for final analysis):

1)  Computing the mean absolute value of the difference between the
    actual number and participant's estimate.

"T1E1" below denotes participant's answer to estimate 1 at time 1
"TrueNumber" denotes the solution to the estimation problem

COMPUTE ErT1E1=ABS(TrueNumber-T1E1). VARIABLE LABELS ErT1E1 'Absolute
error at time 1 for estimate 1'. EXECUTE.

COMPUTE MerT1=MEAN(ErT1E1, ErT1E2, ErT1E3, .... ). VARIABLE LABELS MerT1
'Mean error in time 1'. EXECUTE.

2)  Computing the mean error across Time 1 and Time 2.

COMPUTE MerTot=MEAN(MerT1, MerT2). VARIABLE LABELS MerTot 'Mean error
across time 1 and time 2'. EXECUTE.

3)  Computing the accuracy gain, defined as the mean decrease in error
    of the average of the two estimates relative to the first estimate,
    across items.

COMPUTE AccGain=MerT1-MerTot. VARIABLE LABELS AccGain 'Accuracy gain
defined as mean decrease in error of the average of the two estimates
relative to the first estimate, across items'. EXECUTE.

## Analysis Plan {.unnumbered .unlisted}

### Statistical models {.unnumbered .unlisted}

We will test whether the extent of accuracy gain differs between the two
conditions. Accuracy gain is defined as the mean decrease in error of
the average of the two estimates relative to the first estimate, across
items.

### Transformations {.unnumbered .unlisted}

N/A.

### Inference criteria {.unnumbered .unlisted}

We will use p-values to infer about the significant difference between
the dialectical and second estimate condition.

### Data exclusion {.unnumbered .unlisted}

Participants younger than 18, non-UK residents and those who do not
consent to the use of their data based on their answer will not be
allowed to proceed with the study so, If our procedure is correctly
executed, their data will not be collected at all.

In one of the individual difference measures in the study we will embed
one test question (e.g., This is a test question. To show that you are
paying attention please click "Completely Disagree").

We might also exclude extremely long or short completion times.

### Missing data {.unnumbered .unlisted}

We will only analyse data from participants who completed the whole
questionnaire. This is because, for participants, closing the browser
was defined as a way of withdrawing from the study.

### Exploratory analysis {.unnumbered .unlisted}

N/A.
